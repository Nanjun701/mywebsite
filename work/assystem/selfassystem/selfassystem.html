  <h5>Self as System</h5>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>In this project, I created a piece that uses a dataset to explore/provoke/undo the notion of a “self.” It started with personal data downloaded from Google research history, and reflect on how this info does / doesn’t / could represent myself, as well as its potential insights and biases. </p>
