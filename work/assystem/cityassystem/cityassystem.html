  <h5>City as System: Soft Boundaries</h5>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>From the real to the virtual, cities are composed of people, biotic communities, meteorological systems, and visible and invisible layers of infrastructure and materiality. Similarly, our urban experiences are imbued with the traces of data, images, maps, narratives, and history.
In this project, I selected a Site of Interest (SOI) as a lens for understanding and deconstructing the city. By collecting “data points” through observation or field research, I transformed these findings and data into creative responses in the form of maps.</p>
