    <h5>Silenced Truth</h5>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>"Silenced Truth" is an immersive interactive space installation that explores how mainstream media shapes public perception through information screening. The installation is inspired by the media phenomenon in my hometown: in the urban development narrative, only economic growth and modernization achievements are emphasized, while poverty, marginalized groups and real problems remain silent. When the audience enters this space, the outer wall will display the highlight propaganda content, and after the audience approaches and is captured by the camera, the inner wall will gradually reveal the "hidden" sounds and images.

<br>The audience's position and movement will directly affect the presentation of the content, simulating the process of being screened and decoded. This interactive response to the "media perspective" invites the audience to reflect on who defines the information we see every day and why it is screened. This work aims to arouse people's attention to information transparency, the distribution of discourse power and the silenced groups.</p>
