    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I have a severe case of procrastination and there are always all sorts of things that would normally stop me from starting to study, and I kept track of what was causing me to procrastinate each day of the week. I found a lot of things that were unnecessary to do but I still prioritized them over studying.</p>
