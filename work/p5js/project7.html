    <h5>Autobiographical Game: Lens Journey</h5>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>During my first year in New York, my school went on a month-long strike and I was so bored that I planned to do something fun. My friends always told me that I was good at taking pictures, so I decided then to try to become a photographer. This game is about how I started by buying a camera, then managed to take a lot of orders from customers, to now I decided to take professional photography classes and buy a new camera.
        (Specific story: buying a used camera - trying to shoot for the first time on Halloween (for free) - shooting in various places in NYC - small gains - deciding to further my skills)
        The game is set on a map of New York City to show my experiences exploring various places. Points represent the “currency” of the game.</p>
