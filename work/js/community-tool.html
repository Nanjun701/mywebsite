  <h5>Community Tool</h5>
  <h3>Proposal</h3>
  <p>This tool is designed specifically for individuals who are interested in exploring authentic Chinese cuisine but aren't sure where to start. Chinese cuisine spans vast regions, each with its own unique culinary traditions and habits. Among these, the "Eight Major Cuisines" represent the most iconic and well-known culinary styles across China. Through an interactive quiz consisting of eight engaging questions about flavor preferences, regional leanings, and dining contexts, users quickly discover which of these eight cuisines best matches their tastes. At the end of the quiz, users receive a concise introduction to their recommended cuisine, complete with its name, representative dish images, and distinctive characteristics. The goal is to empower users to confidently explore and enjoy authentic, classic Chinese culinary experiences.</p>
