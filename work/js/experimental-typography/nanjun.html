    <h5>Word 3: Nanjun</h5>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is my name. When the mouse is clicked, the points will be enlarged sequentially in near top to bottom order, the enlarged dots are shown in gradient color with glowing effect, while the unenlarged dots remain white.
        The whole animation shows the visual change of the name from the original state gradually zoomed in, I plan to apply it to my website homepage to make the website more vivid.</p>
