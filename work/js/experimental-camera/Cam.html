    <h5>Experimental Camera</h5>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is an interactive camera with three filters. Each filter represents a media perspective: 
        a biased reporting perspective, an overly embellished image package, and a seemingly real but always scrutinized “self”.
        
        The camera automatically mixes the three filters based on your position in the frame.
        The more you move, the more a filter “invades” the image.
        The result is a “you” that is constantly being molded, distorted, and blended.
    </p>
